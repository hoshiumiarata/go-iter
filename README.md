# iter

This package provides a set of functions for working with strongly typed iterators.

It can work with any type that implements the Iterable interface, and it can also be extended with custom functions.

Check out [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hoshiumiarata/go-iter) for more information.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/hoshiumiarata/go-iter
```

## Example

Example that generates infinite sequence of random numbers and takes first 3 of them.
Then it adds index to each element and converts it to map.

```go
gen := iter.Generator(func() (int, bool) {
    return rand.Int(), true
})
take := iter.Take(gen, 3)
withIndex := iter.WithIndex(take)
m := iter.ToMap(withIndex)
fmt.Println(m)
// => map[0:8705785567292219898 1:5313896861634354376 2:4299041275511179335]
```
